					<h1>Hi, I'm <strong>Paul Luo</strong>ðŸ˜„</h1>
					<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
				</header>
				<hr>
				<p>
					I'm an aspiring Software Engineer eager to explore and learn the many facets of Computer Science.
					My passion for solving real-world problems through scalable and maintanable coding practices drives me 
					to not only become a better Software Engineer, but <b>person</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm currently looking for a New Graduate Software Engineering role for the year 2021.
				</p>
				<p>Feel free to learn a little more about me and/or contact me using the tabs above <i class="far fa-hand-point-up"></i>. Enjoy!</p>
				<p>
					You can also download a copy of my <em><u>resume</u></em> here!

				<p>
					Currently, I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan <span id="blue">(GO BLUE!)</span>.
					From the picture above you might be able to guess that I play ice hockey, and I do! I've been playing ice hockey for more than 15 years
					and I haven't stopped yet; I play for the UofM ACHA Men's Division II team. Apart from that I've also been playing the saxophone
					since elementary school, and was first tenor in my middle school through high school jazz ensembles. I love to cook, but I absolutely adore eating 
					and traveling to do so.

				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from my extracurriculars, my main focus and passion resides in coding. I truly enjoy 
					being able to use my creativity and experience to solve complex problems that involve having to 
					connect different pieces of knowledge I've learned about Computer Science over the years. I appreciate
					environments that challenge me to be the best Software Engineer that I can be, while supporting and mentoring
					me throughout that journey <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					 Some Computer Science tracks I've crossed paths with include full-stack software development, data and information systems,
					 security, and basic artificial intelligence/machine learning. I'm actively searching for any roles in
					 these fields and would be extremely grateful if given any opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>Here are some of the technical skills I've had experience with:</p>

									<h5 class="card-title">Recipe App (in progress)</h5>
									<p class="card-text">
										Mainly an application where users can login and keep track of liked recipes from 
										different websites, or create their own recipes to either be shared and/or kept secret.
										Users will be able to send different media files to each other including (but not limited to)
										videos, pictures, etc. of their favorite foods! I applied my knowledge of React to display
										a user-frriendly interface equipped with helpful links and easy to look at tabs. While this 
										project was meant for personal use only during the Covid-19 pandemic (I had a ton of time to
										learn different recipes and cook them), I've decided to eventually deploy this application using 
										AWS S3, so that others who are interested can find that perfect dish!

									<h5 class="card-title">Business Review App</h5>
									<p class="card-text">
										An officially deployed web application where users can post their business inqueries and comment on other
										users' posts. Browse what other users have to offer, and have the ability to create, edit, and delete previous posts
										or comments made by yourself. The front-end was developed using React along with some pieces of Bootstrap, while the back-end 
										was integrated using a MongoDB database, Express.js, and Node.js. A working authentication schema was implemented 
										using Passport.js, and RESTful routing was followed for the landing page, register page, etc. This project mimics 
										closely to the general idea of Yelp only without the more complex rating systems and other tidbits.

									<h5 class="card-title">Social Media Simulator</h5>
									<p class="card-text">
										A project to showcase my querying abilities and all the things I've learned about databases and management systems. 
										I initially designed a relational database that emulates that of the popular social media website 'Facebook',
										with users, friends, cities, hometowns, photos, etc; and created tables with OracleSQL in Boyceâ€“Codd normal form
										(BCNF). Combining that foundation with Java embedded SQL queries with the help of JDBC, I was able to ultimately convert the 
										results of the queries into JSON format for easier exportation into MongoDB and extraction using vanilla JavaScript. 
										I really enjoyed being able to transfer what I learned about relational and non-relational databases into working 
										code that simulates significant real-life applications.

									<h5 class="card-title">3D Maze Game Solver</h5>
									<p class="card-text">
										My first-ever individual project that I cherish nostalgically. The project is essentially a "design your own"
										maze game, where a user specifies a starting and ending point using ASCII characters, but also has to create
										their own maze primarily using letters and the pound (#) character as walls/doors. The map is then imported 
										and read through the command line, where my C++ program utilizes the stack and queue data structures along with
										depth-first-search (DFS) and breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithms to determine an optimal path through the maze. 
										The program would then translate and output each step to complete the maze if possible onto a text file within the same directory.
